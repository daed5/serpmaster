# What Is Google Shopping API? 

SERPMaster's Google Merchant API delivers scraped product data from Google Shopping in real-time. Users can send highly customized requests to our endpoint - see the [Easy Integration](https://serpmaster.com/products/google-shopping-api/) section on our website. They can alter the location, device, browser and many other parameters according to their needs and we retrieve the Google Shopping result data for them.
    
# How Does It Work? 

**Here's how to send a request to our Google Product API:**
<br> 1. Include the two mandatory parameters: `scraper=google_shopping_search` and `q=any search phrase` for the desired query. 
<br> 2. Enter additional parameters if needed: e.g., location or browser. [Here](https://docs.serpmaster.com/docs/parameter-values) you can see parameter values further explained. 
<br> 3. Receive ready-to-use product data.
